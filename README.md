Recipe Rich Pins for WordPress + ZipList
===

**ZipList is officially shut down as of December 10, 2014. This plugin will no longer function nor receive any new updates.**

**We recommend [Easy Recipe Plus](http://www.easyrecipeplugin.com/) as it includes recipe rich pin features alongside being a great recipe plugin replacement.**

If you're using the [ZipList recipe plugin](http://wordpress.org/plugins/ziplist-recipe-plugin/), your recipe posts already output most of the fields you need for rich pins.

This plugin simply adds any missing [Schema.org](http://schema.org) meta tags and provides a link on each post edit screen to quickly validate all fields with Pinterest.
