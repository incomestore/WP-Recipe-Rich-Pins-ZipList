Add recipe rich pin meta data to your ZipList recipes for enhanced pins on Pinterest.

== Description ==

If you're using the [ZipList recipe plugin](http://wordpress.org/plugins/ziplist-recipe-plugin/), your recipe posts already outputs most of the fields you need for rich pins.

This plugin simply adds any missing [Schema.org](http://schema.org) meta tags and provides a link on each post edit screen to quickly validate all fields with Pinterest.
