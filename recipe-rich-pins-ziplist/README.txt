Add recipe rich pin meta data to your ZipList recipes for enhanced pins on Pinterest.

== Description ==

Add recipe rich pin meta data to your ZipList recipes for enhanced pins on Pinterest.

ZipList does most of the work. We just add a couple things to help.

Basically, we add any missing [Schema.org](http://schema.org) meta tags Pinterest requires that ZipList doesn't provide, along with a link to verify each recipe when you're editing a post.

See [Pinterest's rich pin specifications](http://developers.pinterest.com/rich_pins/) for more info.
